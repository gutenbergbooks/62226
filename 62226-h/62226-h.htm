<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_WORD_ABOUT_BIRD-KEEPING">A WORD ABOUT BIRD-KEEPING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have never looked with perfect complacency
on the keeping of birds in cages; for it looks very
much like an unnatural imprisonment. They have
not space to fly about, and there is something painful
in seeing them flitting up and down on two or
three spars within very narrow bounds, or looking
through the wires of their cage as if wishful to get
out. It would, however, be of no use to remonstrate
against a practice that is common not only
over all England but over the whole civilised
world. Besides, the keepers of pet birds are not
without arguments in their favour. Most of the
birds to be seen in cages, such as canaries, goldfinches,
or siskins, have been bred in confinement.
They never knew what it was to be at liberty, and
in their helpless inexperience, if let loose, they
would inevitably perish. There is much truth in
this species of excuse for bird-keeping. Some
weight is also to be attached to the plea that the
little creatures are, generally speaking, so happy in
their captivity that many of them live to an old
age—say twelve or thirteen years, and keep on
piping their ‘wood-notes wild’ to the last. There
may be the further apology, that the maintenance
of birds in cages communicates happiness to
invalids, or to persons who do not go much from
home. There is cheerfulness in their song, and a
degree of amusement in witnessing their movements,
as well as in attending to their simple
wants. Altogether, therefore, there is a good deal
to say for bird-keeping. It is not quite so inhumane
a practice as it at first appears. In short,
birds, like dogs, may be viewed in the light of
domestic solacements kindly sent by Providence.
Their society and grateful attachment help to fill
up many a melancholy gap.</p>

<p>These ideas have been suggested to us by an
accidental interview with a Dealer in Birds, who
in his own way was apt in the philosophy of the
subject. If people would have birds, it was his
business to supply them with what they wanted,
and he did so with as great tenderness of feeling
as the fragile nature of the article dealt in demanded.
He had much to explain respecting the
importation of song-birds, and the breeding of them
in cages. But on neither of these points shall we
say anything. What especially interested us were
this intelligent dealer’s observations on the proper
method of keeping birds. Some folks, he said,
have a notion that all you have to do is to buy a
bird, put it into a cage, and give it food and water
as directed. That is far from being enough. The
habits of the animal must be studied. The climate
of the room in which it lives, the amount of daylight
it should enjoy, the atmosphere it breathes,
its freedom from sudden alarms—all have to be
thought of, if you wish the bird to be happy; and
without that it has little chance of being a pleasant
companion.</p>

<p>When the dealer began business many years
ago, he was very unfortunate as concerns his
stock. He occupied as good a shop as any one
in the trade. The birds arranged all around in
their respective cages, ready for the inspection
of customers, were as merry as birds could be.
They sung in full pipe, as if rivalling each other
in their gaiety. Provided with appropriate food,
with pure water, and fresh air, they had not a
want unsupplied. Without any apparent reason,
they began to droop and to moult. This did not
alone occur at the season when such might be
expected. Their moulting was often fatal. Vexed
at cases of mortality notwithstanding all his care,
the dealer bethought himself that the use of
gas in his shop might be injurious, so for gas
he substituted an oil-lamp light. Still they
drooped and died. He next in various ways
and at some expense improved the ventilation of
his shop. Still they drooped and died.</p>

<p>What could be the matter? Puzzled to the
last extent, the bird-dealer at length conjectured
what might be the cause of these numerous
deaths. Could it be that the birds wore themselves
out singing? If so, the only way to stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>{114}</span>
them was to shorten the time they were exposed
to the light, for if kept in the dark they are not
inclined to sing.</p>

<p>The supposition proved to be correct. He
shut up his shop at an early hour, and from that
time the mortality of the birds ceased. During
the day they had just that amount of singing
that suited their constitutions, and in the evening
they were left to their repose. This bird-dealer’s
ingenious discovery seems exceedingly rational.
In a state of nature, small birds flit about and sing
only during daylight. They retire to rest at sundown.
This procedure requires to be imitated in
keeping birds artificially. If you let them sing all
day and several hours additional by lamp-light,
you over-fatigue them. The labour is too much.
Of course the birds do not understand that they
had better be silent when the lamp or candles are
lit. They instinctively keep singing on, as if it
were still daylight. The immediate effect of this
over-fatigue is that the poor birds are apt to moult,
and become attenuated; and suffering from premature
exhaustion, they speedily perish.</p>

<p>The dealer mentions that few birds subject to
the exhaustion of singing beyond ordinary daylight
survive more than two years. This does not surprise
us. How could any of our public vocalists,
male or female, and of even a robust constitution,
endure the tear and wear of singing under a
mental strain for any great length of time, as much
as eighteen hours a day? If human beings would
thus sink under the effort of over-work, we need
not wonder that the fragile creatures we are
speaking of should succumb and drop from their
perch.</p>

<p>As a means, therefore, of protecting the lives of
pet birds, the recommendation is, to remove the
cages to a darkened apartment at nightfall, or if
they are not removed, to cover up every cage with
a dark cloth before lighting the gas or oil-lamps.
In shifting birds from one room to another, it is
important to see that there be no change in the
temperature. If removed to a different temperature,
there is a chance of their moulting, which
may be preliminary to something more serious.
Let it be always kept in mind that Nature supplies
a coat to suit the heat or cold in which the
creatures are placed. By changing a bird from a
warm to a cold climate, birds change their coat
and get one that is heavier, and <i>vice versâ</i>, so, by
repeated changes they are kept continually moulting,
instead of once a year, as they ought to do.</p>

<p>We have referred principally to the treatment of
small song-birds, the delicacy of which calls for
particular attention. But our observations in the
main apply to all birds whatsoever. If it be wrong
to keep a little bird singing beyond its constitutional
capacity, so it would be wrong to over-work
a parrot by causing it to speak eighteen hours on
a stretch. It would seem that by this degree of
loquacity, the parrot has a tendency to take some
kind of bronchial affection, analogous to the
ailment of preachers, usually known as ‘the minister’s
sore throat,’ and which, if not checked in
time, may prove equally disastrous.</p>

<p>We have thrown these interesting facts together
not only in the interest of bird-keepers, but for the
sake of inculcating kindness to animals.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MY_KITMITGHAR_SAM">MY KITMITGHAR ‘<i>SAM</i>.’</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> nearly three years my Kitmitghar, as that
functionary is called, was cook, butler, and factotum
of my then small bachelor establishment
in India. A cunning concocter of mulligatawnies,
curries, and chutnies—as cunning a hand too in
‘cooking’ his daily bazaar accounts, adding annas
and pice, for his own particular benefit, to the
prime cost of as many articles as possible. Mildly
remonstrated with, and petty larceny hinted at,
his honest indignation would be aroused. ‘Master
tink I cheat,’ he would say; ‘master can inquire
bazaar-mans;’ well knowing, the rogue, the moral
and almost physical impossibility of ‘master’—a
swell in his way—going to the distant market in a
broiling sun, and finding out the ruling prices of
flesh and fowl.</p>

<p>This worthy, whose original cognomen of <i>Mootoosammy</i>
was shortened into ‘<i>Sam</i>’ for convenience
and euphony sakes, was a Tamil from the
Malabar Coast. <i>Au reste</i>, a dark, handsome,
stoutly-built, clean-looking native, on whose
polished skin water and coarse country soap were
evidently no strangers. In his early youth, fated
to earn his own living, he had been ejected from
the paternal hut and placed as a <i>chokerah</i> or
dressing-boy to a fiery and impecunious lieutenant
of infantry; and under the fostering care of that
impetuous and coinless officer, his indoctrination
into the art and mystery of a valet had been
advanced and improved by sundry ‘lickings,’ and
by frequent applications to his ebon person of
boot-heels, backs of brushes, and heavy lexicons
of the English and Hindustani languages. This
education completed, and when he had learned to
appreciate the difference between uniform and
mufti, mess-dress and parade-dress, and indeed to
master the intricacies of his employer’s scanty
wardrobe—<i>non sine lacrymis</i>, not without ‘howls’—then
he emerged from dressing-boyhood, was
promoted <i>matie</i> or under-butler, and got translated
into more pretentious bungalows than those of
indigent subalterns. By-and-by further preferment
awaited him; he became <i>kitmitghar</i> (major-domo)
in the households of unmarried civilian or
military swells, and thenceforward led a life free
from kicks and cuffs, canes and whips, and impromptu
missiles snatched from toilet or study
tables. I have said advisedly ‘unmarried,’ for
except under financial difficulties, Sam would not
take service with the Benedicts of Indian society,
and the actual presence or possible advent of a
wife was the signal for his departure. ‘Plenty too
much bodder wid lady; too much want ebery day,
ebery day measure curry stuff, oil, ghee [butter];
too much make say always dis ting too dear, dat
ting too dear; too much trouble take count.
Now, Colonel Sahib he good man; he call, he
say: “Sam! how much this week you eespend?
[spend].” He just look book; he give rupee; no
one single word <i>bobberee</i> [fuss] make.’ And so, for
a palpable reason, my worthy cook-butler eschewed
those households where a better-half took the
reckoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>{115}</span></p>

<p>English, after the rickety fashion of a Madrassee,
Sam spoke fairly enough; he also read and wrote
the language, the latter accomplishment phonetically,
but yet sufficiently near to the rules of
orthography to make you fully understand and
pay for ‘tirty seers wrice’ as thirty seers (measures)
of rice. What if he did elect to spell rice
with a <i>w</i>? Is it not recorded that an eminent member
of a large mercantile firm, in days long gone
by, invariably included an <i>h</i> in the word sugar?
And is it not also chronicled how he chastised
almost to the death his son and heir for omitting
that letter when invoicing a cargo of best Jamaica
moist? If then Blank Blank, Esq. of the city
of London opined that sugar required an <i>h</i>, why
not the same liberty as regards the <i>w</i> to Mootoosammy
of the city of Madras?</p>

<p>A sad waverer in religious opinions Master Sam,
I fear. A very Pharisee of a Hindu, a rigid
stickler for the worship of Vishnu or Siva on the
high-days and holidays of those deities, when his
forehead and arms would be spotted and streaked
with coloured ashes, his garments would smell of
saffron and sandal-wood, his English diminutive
name would be put aside for its more lengthy and
sonorous native patronymic, and he would be off
to the temple to make <i>poojah</i> (prayer) to his
<i>swamis</i> (gods). But yet, somehow or other, all
these symptoms and signs of Hinduism would
disappear at Christmas, Easter, or Whitsuntide.
At those seasons of the Christian year, Sam was
no longer Mootoosammy, but Sam pure and simple.
No more the believer he in the Vedahs and
Shastras, but a pinner of faith on Aves and
Credos; no <i>poojah</i> for him now in the temple,
but crossings and genuflections in the little chapel
of the station. Not a trace in these days of
idolatrous scents clinging to cloths and turban,
or of ‘caste’ marks disfiguring brow or limb.
Dole in hand—obtained either from pickings at
master’s ’counts or from bazaar-man’s <i>dustoor</i>
(custom)—he is off to join Father Chasuble’s small
flock, and to bow down and formalise with the
best or worst of that good priest’s congregation.
I really think and believe, that to secure a holiday
and an ‘outing,’ Sam would have professed himself
a Mohammedan during the Ramadan, a Hebrew
during the Passover, a Heathen Chinee during
the feast of Lanterns, and a Buddhist during the
Perihara or other high-jinks of the yellow-robed
priests of Gautama Buddha.</p>

<p>I never before or since met any man into whose
household death was so constantly making inroads,
and strange to say, carrying away the same individual.
I suppose that, on a rough estimate, all
Sam’s kith and kin died at least twice during the
thirty months or so that he was in my service.</p>

<p>‘Master please’—thus Sam howling and weeping
after his kind—‘scuse [excuse] me. Gib tree day
leave go Madras; too much trouble my house.
My poor old mudder—booh! ooh!—plenty long
time sick; master know well; too much old got;
die last night. Booh! ooh! o-o-g-h!’</p>

<p>‘Why, what tomfoolery is this?’ I reply. ‘Your
mother dead! Dead <i>again</i>! Why, man, how can
that be? Four months ago you came and told
me your mother was dead; you got four rupees
advance; you went off, leaving the boy to do
your work, and put me to no end of inconvenience.
How can the old woman be dead
again?’</p>

<p>But the fellow is not the least put out, and
is quite equal to the ‘fix.’ ‘Master Sahib,’ he says,
‘I beg you scuse me. Sahib quite wrong. That
time you speak I get leave, not <i>my</i> mudder—my
<i>wife’s</i> mudder die. Master can look book!’</p>

<p>This random shot anent the ‘book’ alludes to
my diary, in which the disbursement of the money
has been entered, but not of course the casualty
in his family. But I don’t lose the hint nevertheless,
and I jot down a memorandum for future
reference, should occasion require.</p>

<p>Then Sam goes on: ‘I no tell lie, sar. Plenty
true; too much bobberee my house make. My
fader gone Mysore’——</p>

<p>‘Why, bless my heart!’ I put in, ‘you told
me ages ago your father died of cholera in Masulipatam.’</p>

<p>‘No, sar,’ says Sam; ‘never, sar! My grand-fader,
scuse me. My wife she catch bad fever.
No one single person my home got, make funeral-feast.
Please, my master, advance half-month’s
pay; gib four days’ leave. I too much hurry
come back.’ Then he falls down, clasps my feet,
calls me his father, brother; gets my consent to
be absent, handles the rupees, and is off like a
shot; not of course to his mother’s obsequies, for
the old harridan has either been buried or burned
years ago, or even now is all alive and kicking;
but to some spun-out native theatricals, nautch,
or <i>tamasha</i> (entertainment) in Black Town, where
he feasts, drinks, and sleeps, and for a week
at least I see his face no more.</p>

<p>History repeats itself; so does Sam. Months
and months have passed; I am away from the
neighbourhood of the Presidency town, and on
the cool Neilgherry Hills. Enters one morning
my man into my sitting-room, a letter in his hand,
written in Tamil, and which he asks me to read,
well knowing that I can’t, that except a very few
of the commonest words of the language, which
I speak with an uncertain not to say incorrect
idea of their meaning, the tongue of his forebears,
scriptural and oral, is to me Chaldee or Arabic.</p>

<p>‘Well! what’s up now?’ I say ‘<i>Ennah?</i>’ airing
one of the expressions I know.</p>

<p>‘Master can see self. My uncle he send chit
[note]; just now tappal-man [postman] bring. He
write, say: “Sam! you plenty quick come Madras.”
He put inside letter one five-rupee government
note. Sahib can see. He tell me no one minute
lose; take fire-road [railway]; too soon come;
plenty, plenty trouble. <i>My mudder dead.</i>’</p>

<p>‘You awful blackguard!’ I exclaim. ‘Your
mother dead—dead again! Look here—look here!’
And I turn up my diary and shew him, under
date August 9, 186-, nearly two years past and
gone: ‘Sam’s mother reported dead for the
second time by Sam, &amp;c.’</p>

<p>Then he slinks away discomfited; and I hear
him in his smoky kitchen growling and grumbling,
and no doubt anathematising me and mine past,
present, and future.</p>

<p>My first introduction to Sam was after this
wise. I had come down from Bombay to Beypore
with troops in a small steamer, and Mr Sam, who
had either deserted or been sent away from the
Abyssinian Expedition, in which he had been a
camp-follower, was also a passenger in the same
ship. Of this craft a word <i>en passant</i>, for I have to
this day a lively and by no means pleasant olfactory
recollection of her. She was the dirtiest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>{116}</span>
vessel in which I ever put foot; guiltless of paint
from keel to truck; all grime, coal-soot, and tar
from stem to stern. She had but recently taken a
cargo of mules to Annesley Bay; and but scant
if any application of water and deodorants had
followed the disembarkation of the animals. The
‘muley’ flavour still therefore clung closely to
bulkhead and planking; it hung about cordage
and canvas; it penetrated saloon and sleeping-berth;
it even overpowered the smell of the rancid
grease with which pistons and wheels were lubricated.
Worthy Captain B—— the skipper assured
us that deck and hold, sides and bulwarks,
had been well scoured in Bombay; but as the old
salt’s views of scrubbing, judging from his personal
appearance, were infinitesimally limited, we opined
that the ship’s ablution had been as little as was
that of its commander’s diurnal tub.</p>

<p>But to return to Sam. The poor fellow was
wandering about the streets of Beypore coinless
and curry-and-rice-less, when he stumbled upon
me. He was seeking, he told me, from some good
Samaritan of an officer, a free convoy to Madras
as his servant; and as I happened to be in a position
entitled to passes for some three or four
followers at government expense, I was enabled
to pour oil and wine into Sam’s wounds, and
without even the disbursement to mine host the
assistant-quartermaster-general, of the traditional
‘tuppence,’ to get him across from terminus to
terminus—some four hundred long miles—and
without once casting eyes on him. But at Lucifer’s
hotel in Madras where I stayed—— What a
memory of mosquitoes, fleas, and other nimble insects
doth it bring! What a night-band of croaking
frogs and howling jackals it kept! What
packs of prowling pariah dogs and daringly thieving
crows congregated about its yards and outhouses!
What repulsive nude mendicants and fakeers
strolled almost into its very verandahs! What
a staff of lazy sweepers, slow-footed ‘boys,’ and
sleepy punkah-pullers crawled about it generally!
And last, though not least, what a wretched ‘coolie-cook’
superintended its flesh-pots, from which
not even the every-day stereotyped prawn curry,
boiled seer-fish, and grilled <i>morghee</i> (fowl) could
creditably and palatably issue. At this Stygian
caravanserai then, Sam, whom I thought I had bid
adieu to for ever and a day on the railway platform,
turns up again clean and smirk, salaams,
asks for permanent employment, produces a thick
packet of highly laudatory characters (mostly, I
had no doubt, either fabricated by a native scribe
in the Thieves’ Bazaar at Black Town, or borrowed
for the occasion from some other brother-butler),
gets engaged; and from that moment, both figuratively
and literally, begins to eat my salt. Nor
did the saline feasting fail to give him a taste
for liquor—for alcoholic, decidedly alcoholic were
Sam’s proclivities. He drank at all times and in
all places; but his favourite day and locality was
Tuesday, at the weekly market of the cantonment.
Then and there he imbibed right royally, and
staggering home—the coolies with the supplies
following him as tipsy as himself—went straight
to his mat-spread <i>charpoy</i> (bedstead).</p>

<p>‘Hollo, Sam!’ I exclaim; ‘at it again; drunk
as usual from <i>shandy</i> [market].’</p>

<p>‘No, shar! Dis time no shrunk! Shun too
mush hot! Splenshy head pain gib! Too mush
make shake, sthagger, shar! No, mash-err, no!
Sham not shrunk! Plenty shick! Shmall glass
brandy—all right, shar!’</p>

<p>But I decline to add ‘the sum of more to that
which hath too much,’ and I leave Sam to sober
himself as he best can, and which, truth to say,
he quickly does.</p>

<p>In the way of intoxicants nothing came amiss to
my man’s unfastidious palate. He had no particular
‘wanity,’ like Old Weller’s friend the red-nosed
Shepherd: Henneysey’s brandy, Kinahan’s whisky,
Boord’s gin, Bass’s ale, Guinness’s stout, champagne,
sherry, claret—all and each were equally acceptable;
and failing these European liquors, then
the vile palm-toddy and killing mango-spirit of
the neighbouring native stills supplied their place.
Bar the toddy and mango stuff, which were cheap
and easily obtained, Sam did not disburse much
for his wine-cellar; master’s sideboard and stores,
guard them as he would, came cheaper and handier.
Every bottle, somehow or other, got ‘other lips’
than mine and my friends’ applied to it, and its
contents went into and warmed other ‘hollow
hearts’ than ours. Sam laid an embargo on and
helped himself from all. He it is, I fancy, to
whom Aliph Cheem alludes in his Lay of Ind entitled
<i>The Faithful Abboo</i>, that trusty servant who,
habitually stealing his master’s liquor, and accusing
his brother-domestics, got caught and half-poisoned
by mistaking in his prowls Kerosine for
Old Tom. A misadventure not unlike befell Sam;
but in that instance he did not ‘strike oil,’ but
came upon a very nauseating dose of tartar emetic,
and was ‘plenty sick’ and ‘plenty shame’ for
some hours after.</p>

<p>Another predilection of my factotum’s was
tobacco, which he smoked without ceasing, and
without the least regard to quality or fabric.
‘Long-cut or short-cut’ to him ‘were all the same.’
But as I did not happen to be addicted to the
‘nicotian weed’ Sam could not draw on any
resources of mine, but had to depend on his own
means, supplemented by the surreptitious abstraction
of Trichys and Manillas, of Latakia and Bird’s-eye,
from the boxes and pouches of my chum
and visitors.</p>

<p>Every native gambles; so it could hardly be
expected that Sam should differ from his brethren
in this respect. In the words of the old ditty
anent Ally Croker:</p>

<p>I don’t think he cared much for cards or dice; but
the game that he delighted in was played with a
red and white checkered square of cloth, and with
round pieces like draughtsmen. Whenever the
advent of a friend and opportunity served, down
the two squatted with this board between their
legs, and a pile of copper pieces of money by their
sides; and so intent would they be on their play,
that nothing short of a gentle kick, or tap on the
head, would arouse them to master’s wants and
needings.</p>

<p>My readers will naturally inquire why, with
all these delinquencies, Sam so long remained
my henchman. Well, first, had I discharged him,
another and probably greater robber would have
stepped into his shoes, and bazaar accounts and
inroads on alcohol and tobacco would have remained
undiminished. ‘They all do it;’ so better
the de’il I knew, than the de’il whose acquaintance
I would have to make. Again, Sam had his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>{117}</span>
redeeming points; he was, as I have said before,
clean, handy, and deft at the creature comforts,
which, having appetisingly compounded, he could
serve up with taste and elegance. Then he was
a good nurse; and during a serious illness that
befell me at one of the vilest stations in Madras,
he tended me closely and carefully, keeping a
watchful eye and a ready stick on punkah-pullers
and wetters of kus-kus tatties (scented grass mats),
without the cooling aid of which the heat of
that grilling July would have been my death
on that fever-bed. Once more, on those military
inspections which fell to my lot, and which had
to be undertaken partly over the Nizam’s very
sandy and rough highways, and in those close
comfortless bone-breaking vehicles called <i>byle-nibbs</i>
(bullock-carts), my man became invaluable. Seated
on the narrow perch alongside the almost garmentless
and highly odoriferous native driver, he urged
him on by promises of ‘backsheesh’ and cheroots;
he helped to whip and tail-twist the slow-footed
oxen; he roused up lazy <i>byle-wallahs</i> (bullock-men)
sleeping in their hovels, and assisted them
in driving from the fields and in yoking to the
cart refractory and kicking cattle. He stirred
up with the long pole the <i>peons</i> (keepers) in
charge of the road-side travellers’ bungalows at
which we halted, aiding these officials in chasing,
slaughtering, and ‘spatch-cocking’ the ever-waiting-to-be-killed-and-cooked
gaunt and fleshless
<i>morghee</i> (fowl); he saw that the chatties for the
bath were not filled with the very dirtiest of
tank water; that the numerous and hard-biting
insects, out and taking the air from their thickly
populated homes in the crevices of cane-bottomed
chair and bedstead, met with sudden and violent
death; and lastly, that no man’s hand but his
own should be put into master’s money-bag and
stores.</p>

<p>But as all things come to an end more or less,
so did Sam’s career with me actually terminate.
My wife and family came ‘out’ from England.
The ‘Mem Saab,’ sometimes even the ‘Missee
Saab,’ took bazaar ’count; the current bachelor
rates for chillies, cocoa-nuts, first and second
sorts <i>wrice</i>, gram, and such-like necessaries underwent
a fall. Sam’s occupation and gain were
gone. He quitted my homestead under this new
and unprofitable régime. ‘I discharge you, sar!’
said he; and away he went, I know not where.</p>

</div>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.—AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>De Vere Arms</i> at Pebworth, fourth-rate hotel
though it necessarily was in a place where any
hotel of the first or even of the second magnitude
would have been as an oak in a flower-pot, was
well and neatly kept. There was the commercial
connection, and there was the county connection,
both dear to the landlord, but on grounds wholly
dissimilar. Biggles had been butler to the present,
under-butler and knife-boy to the late Earl of
Wolverhampton; and had he but had his own
way, the <i>De Vere Arms</i> would have been strictly
the family hotel which its address-cards proclaimed
it, and the obnoxious word ‘commercial’ would
have found no place there.</p>

<p>Mr Biggles, however, was in the position of one
of those unfortunate managers of English country
theatres who tell their friends, perhaps truly, that
they would play nothing, save the legitimate
drama, if they could help it. They cannot help
it, and scared by the dismal spectre of Insolvency,
they shelve Shakspeare in favour of newer idols
of the public. So did Biggles and worthy Mrs
B. to boot lay themselves out in practice to secure
the lucrative custom of the ready-money, constantly
moving, commercial gentlemen, while in
theory devoting all their loyalty to those of their
patrons who came in their own carriages, with
armorial bearings on their panels and liveried
servants on the driving-seat.</p>

<p>To this hostelry was borne, in Sir Gruntley
Pigbury’s carriage, the insensible form of Jasper
Denzil, supported by the sturdy arm of Captain
Prodgers, while little Dr Aulfus, on the opposite
seat, kept the patient’s nerveless wrist
between his own thin fingers all the way from
the race-course to the inn. Then Jasper, amidst
spasmodic gaspings from the landlady and sympathetic
exclamations from the chambermaids, was
carried into the <i>De Vere Arms</i> and established in
one of the best rooms, whence were summarily
dislodged the effects of some well-to-do customer
who had had a horse in the race, but who was
unlikely under the circumstances to resent the
invasion of his apartment. Jack Prodgers and
the doctor seemed to have taken joint possession
of the invalid; the former as <i>prochain ami</i> (and
it is to the credit of such ne’er-do-wells as Captain
Prodgers that the very wildest of them never
do leave a friend untended in a scrape), and the
other professionally.</p>

<p>Other friends came not. Lord Harrogate did
indeed tap at the door, and so did four or five
officers of the Lancer regiment, but contented
themselves with an assurance that Jasper was in
no immediate danger. And when Blanche Denzil’s
tearful entreaties induced the Earl to solicit admittance
to the sick-room for her at least, the surgeon
went out and politely deprecated her entrance.
Anything which might excite the patient should,
he truly said, be as far as possible avoided. It
was not exactly possible just yet to ascertain the
amount of damage done; but he, the doctor,
anticipated no serious consequences. And with
this assurance the poor sister was compelled to
be content. They say that every educated man
of fifty is a fool or a physician. Jack Prodgers
had seen the light some half-century since, and his
worst enemies—the men whose cash he pouched
at play—would not have taxed him with folly.</p>

<p>‘Now, doctor,’ he said quietly, ‘don’t you think
the best we can do for the poor fellow is to get
his left shoulder into the socket again before the
muscles stiffen?’</p>

<p>The surgeon winced. He knew by the cursory
examination he had made that no bones—unless
it might be the collar-bone, an injury to which is
not always promptly ascertained—were broken;
but here, annoying circumstance! was a dislocation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>{118}</span>
which he had left to be discovered by an
outsider to the profession.</p>

<p>‘Bless my soul!’ he exclaimed, adjusting his
spectacles, ‘so it is. We have no time to lose.’</p>

<p>As it was, time enough had been lost to bring
about a contraction of the muscles, that rendered
it necessary to call in the aid of James the waiter
and Joe the boots, before the hurt shoulder could
be reinstated in its normal position.</p>

<p>The pain of the operation roused Jasper from
his stupor. He moaned several times and stirred
feebly to and fro, and when the wrench was over,
opened his eyes and gazed with a bewildered stare
about him. Very pale and ghastly he looked,
lying thus, with the blood slowly oozing from a
cut on his right temple, and his hair stained and
matted. They sprinkled water on his face and
put brandy to his lips; but he merely groaned
again, and his eyes closed.</p>

<p>‘That’s a very ugly knock on the temple; I
hope there’s no more mischief,’ said the doctor
in a whisper, but speaking more openly than
medicine-men, beside a patient’s bed, often speak
to the laity.</p>

<p>Jack Prodgers shook his head. He was a man
of experience, and had in his time seen some
prompt and easy recoveries, and other cases in
which there was no recovery at all. It was with
some remorse that he looked down at the bruised
and helpless form lying on the bed. His heart
had been case-hardened by the rubs of a worldly
career, but there was a soft spot in it after all, and
it was with sincere joy that he saw at length the
sick man’s eyes open with a glance of evident
recognition, while a wan smile played about his
lips.</p>

<p>‘I say, Jack,’ said Jasper feebly, ‘we’re in a
hole, old man, after all’—— Then he fainted.</p>

<p>‘Nothing the matter with his reason, thank
goodness! It was the shock to the brain I feared
the most for him,’ said the doctor, as again brandy
was administered.</p>

<p>The regular clock-work routine of social machinery
must go on in despite of accidents, and accordingly
the down-train reached Pebworth at 3.40
(or, to tell the truth, a few minutes behind time)
with its usual punctuality. There was no omnibus,
whether from the <i>De Vere Arms</i> or from the
opposition or <i>White Hart</i> hotel, in waiting at
the station, wherefore the few arrivals had to consign
their bales and bags and boxes of samples to
the wheelbarrows of porters, for conveyance to
whichever house of entertainment they designed
to patronise. Amongst these was a thickset
middle-aged man, with trim whiskers, a dust-coloured
overcoat, a slim umbrella, and a plump
black bag, which he preferred to carry as he
trudged from the station to the hotel.</p>

<p>There was nothing very noteworthy about the
new-comer, who was neatly dressed in black, and
wore a hat that was just old enough to have lost
its first tell-tale gloss, except that he had evidently
striven to look some years younger than the parish
register would have proclaimed him. Thus the
purplish tint of his thick whiskers and thinned
hair, heedfully brushed and parted so as to make
the most of it, savoured of art rather than nature.
His cravat too, instead of being black, was what
haberdashers call a scarf of blue silk, of a dark
shade certainly, but still blue, and was secured by
a massive golden horse-shoe. Glittering trinkets
rattled at his watch-chain, and his boots were
tighter and brighter than the boots of men of
business usually are. There is or ought to be a
sort of fitness between clothes and their wearer,
but in the case of this traveller, obviously bound
for the <i>De Vere Arms</i>, no such fitness existed.
That cold gray eye, those deeply marked crow’s-feet,
the coarse mouth, and mottled complexion,
consorted ill with the pretensions to dandyism
indicated by a portion of their owner’s attire.
Altogether, the man might have been set down as
a corn-doctor, a quack, a projector of bubble companies,
or possibly an auctioneer whose hammer
seldom fell to a purely legitimate bid in a fair
market.</p>

<p>As the stranger drew near to the hotel,
having inquired his way once or twice from such
of the natives as the great attraction of the day
had not allured to the race-course, a carriage
dashed past him at a very fast pace indeed, and
drew up with a jerk in front of the <i>De Vere Arms</i>.
The gentleman who alighted from it, tall, and
of a goodly presence, lingered for an instant in
the doorway to give some order to his servants.
As he did so, his eyes encountered those of the
traveller freshly arrived by the train, and who
by this time was beneath the pillars of the porch.
Sir Sykes Denzil, for it was he whose carriage had
just brought him in hot haste to the place where
his son lay ill, started perceptibly and hesitated,
then turned abruptly on his heel and disappeared
within the hotel, greeted by the obsequious Mr
and Mrs Biggles.</p>

<p>Recognition, as we can all avouch, is in the
immense majority of cases simultaneous, one
memory seeming as it were to take fire at the
spark of recollection kindled in the other. In
this instance such was not exactly what occurred.
Yet the traveller with the bag was perfectly
certain that he had seen before the tall gentleman
who had started at the sight of him, and that a
diligent searching of the mental archives would
elicit the answer to the riddle.</p>

<p>‘Have I written or telegraphed to order rooms
here?’ repeated the new arrival testily, after the
flippant waiter who came, flourishing his napkin,
to see what the stranger wanted. ‘No, I have not.
And to judge by the size of your town, my friend,
and the general look of affairs, I should say that
on any other day of the year but this such a
precaution would be wholly superfluous.’</p>

<p>The waiter, who had been slightly puffed up by
the ephemeral vogue of Pebworth and its chief
hotel, took the rebuke meekly. ‘Would you step
into the coffee-room, sir?’ he said. ‘I’ll ask Mrs
Biggles about accommodation likely to be vacant.
Any name I could mention, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Name—yes, Wilkins,’ returned the traveller,
pushing open the door of the coffee-room, in
which, at various tables, some dozen of sporting-men
were making a scrambling meal. One or
two of these looking up from their plates, nodded
a greeting, with a ‘How d’ ye do, Wilkins?’ or
‘How goes it, old fellow?’ salutations which the
recipient of them returned in kind. Then the
waiter bustled in to say, more respectfully than
before, that so soon as No. 28 should be vacated
by a gentleman leaving by the 6.25 train, it would
be at the disposal of Mr Wilkins. Further, here
was a note for Mr Wilkins; into whose hand he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>{119}</span>
proceeded to thrust a half-sheet of letter-paper,
roughly folded in four, and containing but some
two or three lines of blotted handwriting. ‘If
you will so far oblige me’—thus ran the words,
shaky and blurred as to their caligraphy, but
tolerably legible—‘I shall be glad of a few moments’
interview with you, at once if not inconvenient,
in No. 11. I will not detain you.’</p>

<p>There was no signature, but no reasonable doubt
could exist in the mind of Mr Wilkins as to the
note having been penned by the owner of the
carriage that had so lately driven up to the door
of the <i>De Vere Arms</i>.</p>

<p>‘Why, this is taking the bull by the horns,’
said Mr Wilkins, as he rose to obey the summons.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.—IN NO. XI.</h3>

<p>No. 11 was a sitting-room of a class peculiar to
those old-fashioned inns which are rapidly being
improved off the length and breadth of Britain,
large, low-ceiled, with a sloping floor that attained
its highest elevation beside the broad bay-window.
A dark room, it must be confessed, and an airless,
but snug and warm on winter-nights, when the
glow of the firelight combined with the lustre of
many wax-candles to defy the storm and blackness
without. There had been jovial dinners in
that room, and drawing together of arm-chairs
around the huge fireplace, and tapping of dusty
magnums of rare old port, and calling for more
punch as the night waned, in those hard-living
days of which so many of us innocent, pay the
penalty in neuralgia and dyspepsia.</p>

<p>In No. 11 stood Sir Sykes, pale but resolute.
The traveller with the black bag came in, and
for the second time their eyes met. ‘You wished
to see me, sir,’ began Mr Wilkins, with a slight
bow. ‘Ah! I remember you now, sir, as it happens,’
he added in a different tone; ‘remember you very
distinctly indeed, Mr’——</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ interrupted Sir Sykes, with uplifted
fore-finger. ‘A place like this is the very last in
which to mention anything best left unspoken—the
very walls, I believe, have ears to hear and
tongues to tattle. I am Sir Sykes Denzil, of
Carbery Chase, within a very few miles of this, at
your service, Mr Wilkins.’</p>

<p>‘Sir Sykes Denzil! Well, this <i>is</i> a surprise,’
exclaimed the owner of the name of Wilkins
wonderingly, and yet with a sort of dry humour
mingling with his evidently genuine astonishment.
‘Dear me, dear me! They say the world is very
little, and people constantly meeting and jostling
in it; but I never so thoroughly realised the truth
of the saying as I do now. So I’ve the honour of
talking to Sir Sykes Denzil, when I thought I was
addressing’——</p>

<p>‘Be cautious, sir,’ interposed the baronet, with
an energy that impressed the other in spite of
himself. ‘Let us have no reference, if you please,
to a past that is dead and buried. I sent for you,
certain as I was that sooner or later your memory
must recall me to your remembrance, and well
aware too how easily you could learn who I was
here.’</p>

<p>‘No great trouble about that, Mr—I mean Sir
Sykes,’ rejoined the traveller smirkingly. ‘The
people seem to know you well enough, and any
fellow in the stable-yard would have told me
whose was the carriage with the brown liveries.’</p>

<p>‘And having met and recognised one another,’
said Sir Sykes, ‘on what footing is our future
intercourse to be conducted? We are not as we
once were, lawyer and client, and’——</p>

<p>‘No, Sir Sykes, I grant you that; but we might
be,’ returned Mr Wilkins, rubbing his fleshy hands
together, as though they had been two millstones
between which the bones of suitors might be
ground to make his bread. ‘You can’t, a man of
your landed property—I’ve heard something as to
your acreage, and could give a shrewd guess as to
your rent-roll—be without law business. Devonshire
isn’t Arcadia, I suppose. Are there not
leases to draw, inclosure bills to promote, poachers
to prosecute, paths to stop up, bills to file, actions
to bring, defend, compromise? Ten to one, some
of your best farms are let on leases of lives, and——
But no matter! You’ve your own legal advisers;
hey, Sir Sykes?’</p>

<p>The baronet bowed coldly by way of assent.</p>

<p>‘Pounce and Pontifex, of Lincoln’s Inn—<i>I</i>
know,’ pursued the unabashed lawyer. ‘A brace
of respectable twaddling old stagers. There was
a saying, soon after I got my articles, as to that
firm, to the effect that Pounce and Pontifex were
fit for a marriage settlement, a will, and a Chancery
suit, and that was about all. If you care about
raising your rents, crushing an enemy, or gratifying
a whim—and most rich men have a hankering
after one or other of these fancies—why, you’ll
need a brisker counsellor at your elbow than the
jog-trots of Lincoln’s Inn.’</p>

<p>Again the baronet bent his head, and his eyes
moved towards the door. Mr Wilkins noted their
movement.</p>

<p>‘You hardly derived a fair judgment of my
capabilities,’ he said, ‘by the little I had to do
in that Sandston business’——</p>

<p>‘Again I ask you, sir, to make no mention of
that subject. It—it is naturally painful to me—and—and’—— Sir
Sykes here fairly broke down.</p>

<p>The lawyer’s eyes twinkled as he saw his advantage.
‘So long as <i>you</i> remember it, Sir Sykes,’
he made haste to say, ‘I shall be only too happy
to forget the whole concern. What was that story
about the organ-blower and Handel? “Shan’t it
be ‘we,’ then?” said the fellow, when the great
organist couldn’t get a note out of his instrument
for want of the necessary but humble bellows.
And the musician was compelled to acknowledge
that there was a sort of partnership between the
man who fingered the stops and the man who
raised the wind. I’m in no hurry. Think it
over. I have a client to see here to-day; but
perhaps you will let me have a word with you
before you drive back to Carbery Chase.’</p>

<p>A long deep line, which might have been
mistaken for the furrow of some old sword-cut,
running from the angle of the mouth obliquely
upwards, became visible in the baronet’s comely
face as he listened. He was one of those men who
can better endure misfortune than disrespect, and
to whom the bitterest sting of ruin is the withdrawal
of the deference and lip-service which
environ them. But it was in an amicable tone
that he made answer: ‘I shall be happy to pursue
our conversation, Mr Wilkins, to-day or at any
time which you may deem suitable. At present,
however, you will excuse me if I leave you. My
son, Captain Denzil, has been hurt—badly hurt, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>{120}</span>
fear, in the steeplechase to-day, and I have been
called here to see him, where he lies, in this very
hotel.’ And the baronet moved towards the door.</p>

<p>‘Hurt, is he?’ exclaimed Mr Wilkins, with
inconsiderate roughness. ‘Ah, then, I shall look
to you, Sir Sykes, to indemnify me in case’——</p>

<p>Then came an awkward pause. The solicitor
was a remarkably plain-spoken man, but he did
not quite like to say, ‘in case your son’s accident
prove fatal,’ and so stopped, and left his eloquent
silence to complete his words. Sir Sykes, with
his hand on the door, turned, astonished, upon the
attorney.</p>

<p>‘What, pray, have you to do with the illness
or the recovery of Captain Denzil?’ he asked in
evident ill-humour. He had borne up to this
with Mr Wilkins, but the lawyer’s interference
with regard to his son appeared to him in the
light of a gratuitous piece of insolence.</p>

<p>‘Simply,’ returned Mr Wilkins, thrusting his
hand into an inner pocket of his coat, ‘because I
am the holder of certain acceptances, renewed,
renewed afresh, and finally dishonoured; acceptances
amounting, with expenses, to a gross amount
of—shall we say some eleven or twelve thousand,
Sir Sykes? Nearer the twelve than the eleven,
I suspect. A flea-bite of course to a gentleman
of your fortune, but a very important sum to a
plain man like yours truly.’</p>

<p>‘I have been put to heavy expense, very heavy,
for my son’s debts,’ said Sir Sykes, almost piteously.
‘I have paid every’——</p>

<p>‘Now, my very good sir,’ interrupted the
attorney, ‘don’t, I beg you, don’t fall into the
common error of fathers, and imagine that your
own particular son is either a miracle of ingenuous
candour or a prodigal worse than his neighbours.
You think that you’ve paid all his liabilities, Sir
Sykes, and no doubt you have paid all you knew
of. But as a man of the world, if not as a parent,
you ought to be aware that nobody ever did
tell all that he owed—excess of modesty, perhaps!
They always leave a margin, these interesting
penitents; and in this case, as you will see by
these documents’ (and Mr Wilkins produced several
pieces of stamped paper), ‘the margin is tolerably
ample.’</p>

<p>The baronet was now thoroughly roused to
wrath. He strode to and fro with frowning brow
and hands that were fast clenched together, then
walked to the window and stood still, idly tapping
the panes with one white finger, on which there
glistened a great diamond that had been an heirloom
at Carbery Chase before ever a Denzil
crossed its threshold.</p>

<p>‘I’ll not give him a shilling or leave him a
shilling!’ he said in a voice that quivered with
anger. ‘Carbery Chase is my very own, and I
can deal with it as I please. My daughters at
anyrate have deserved better of me than that
thankless graceless boy.’</p>

<p>Sir Sykes, under the influence of this new
emotion, seemed to have forgotten the lawyer’s
presence, or merely to regard Mr Wilkins in the
light of the impartial Chorus in a Greek tragedy;
but the attorney, who was by no means pleased
by the turn which the affair seemed to be taking,
intervened.</p>

<p>‘Come, come, Sir Sykes. It’s natural that you
should be annoyed at having such a heavy bill
presented, when you thought it settled. But
between ourselves, boys will be boys. The captain
has turned over a new leaf, and rely on it he will
be a credit to you yet. I’ve a pretty wide acquaintance
amongst wild young gentlemen of his kind,
and I give you my word I don’t know one who
is more wide-awake. He had paid his ’prentice
fees, and that smartly; but I expect before I die
to hear of him as an ornament to the bench of
magistrates and perhaps a county member. As
for these bills and notes of hand’——</p>

<p>‘I’m not liable for a sixpence!’ exclaimed Sir
Sykes petulantly. ‘My son may go through the
Court if he chooses, and perhaps will learn a
wholesome lesson from the exposure, which’——</p>

<p>‘Fie, fie, Sir Sykes!’ broke in the lawyer.
‘A coat of whitewash, believe me, sticks to a
youngster’s back to that extent that no amount of
scrubbing can get rid of it. Fume and fret as you
please, you know, and I know, that you mean
Captain Jasper to have Carbery after you, and to
keep the place in the Denzil line. Better so, than
to have so fine an estate sold or cut in two for
division between your daughters’ husbands. And
the captain won’t bear the ‘bloody hand’ in his
escutcheon the better because he has been made
an insolvent in his youth. As for these claims, I
don’t press for an immediate settlement; not I; I
don’t exact my pound of flesh down on the nail,
Sir Sykes.’</p>

<p>There was a hard struggle in the baronet’s breast.
Time had been given him for reflection, and he
had used it. To hear of his son’s extravagance,
of his son’s deceit, and from such lips, was bad
enough. To be compelled to endure the familiarity
of the lawyer’s manner was to have to swallow a
still more bitter pill. He could remember Mr
Wilkins of old, blunt and jocose certainly, but by
no means so jaunty in his bearing as he now was,
although Sir Sykes had not then been the rich
county magnate he had blossomed. He felt, and
writhed as he felt, that it was the attorney’s sense
of his hold upon him by reason of his knowledge
of his past life, which had emboldened Mr Wilkins
to deal with him as he had done. But the most
provoking feature of the affair was that Sir Sykes
felt that this man’s advice, coarsely and offensively
administered as it was, yet contained a solid kernel
of truth. Jasper was by no means a model son.
He had committed fearful follies, and incurred
debts which even the Master of Carbery had
thought twice before discharging. His profligacy
was redeemed by no brilliant talents, softened by
no affectionate qualities. There are spendthrifts
who remain lovable to the last, as there are others
who dazzle the world by the glitter of their wit or
valour. To neither category did the graceless offspring
of Sir Sykes belong. And yet, in spite of
his occasional menaces on the subject of his will,
the baronet felt that national manners and family
pride combined to constitute a sort of moral entail,
of which Jasper was to reap the benefit.</p>

<p>‘I must see my son,’ said Sir Sykes smoothly,
after a pause; ‘and when I have time to think
over the matter, Mr Wilkins, I will write to you
appointing as early an interview as possible. In
the meantime I feel assured that you will see the
propriety of not urging personally your claims on
Captain Denzil in his present condition.’</p>

<p>Mr Wilkins was amenity itself. He would but
eat a morsel in the coffee-room, he said, and would
then go back to London by the next train, confident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>{121}</span>
that he could not leave his interests in better
hands than those of Sir Sykes.</p>

<p>‘The old address, sir! You used to know it well
enough!’ said the lawyer with a leer, as he took
the hand which the baronet did not dare to refuse
in sign of friendship; and so they parted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COAL_AND_ITS_PRODUCTS">COAL AND ITS PRODUCTS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an article which appeared in this <i>Journal</i> in
August 1876, entitled <i>The Age of the World</i>, we
endeavoured to explain how coal was produced,
and how it might be regarded simply as stored-up
heat and light, derived from the sun ages ago.</p>

<p>Apart from the varied uses of coal in its ordinary
state, we owe an immense deal to the products
which by chemical means we obtain from it; and
it is our purpose in this paper to briefly review
these products, and to shew how we have adapted
them to our several wants.</p>

<p>The manufacture of gas is undoubtedly the most
important feature in the modern history of coal.
Natural reservoirs of inflammable air exist in
many parts of the world, and have in many cases
been turned to profitable account. In China,
for instance, the evaporation of salt has for many
years been carried on by the heat obtained by the
combustion of gas which issues from the ground.
Streets and buildings there have also been lighted
by the same means. In our own country too, such
eruptions of natural gas—which have generally
manifested themselves during the operation of well-boring—have
not been uncommon. But the gas
so obtained is not the same as that which we get
from the distillation of coal, although it forms one
of its chief constituents. It is commonly called
marsh-gas, from its constant presence in bogs and
places where decaying vegetable matter abounds.
The treacherous Will o’ the Wisp owes its origin to
this gas. It also issues in large quantities from
coal-beds, and diluted with air forms the dreadful
compound called ‘fire-damp.’</p>

<p>The first recorded experiment relating to the
production of true coal-gas was as early as the
year 1660, when a country clergyman distilled
some coal, collected the gas in bladders, and burnt
it from a jet, for the amusement of his friends.
Although this very suggestive experiment was
communicated to the Royal Society, no action
seems to have been taken upon it until the beginning
of the present century, when the matter
seems to have attained a more practical form. At
this time one or two factories in Manchester and
Birmingham were for the first time lighted with
gas. The idea of illuminating an entire town by
means of a chemical vapour seems to have met
with much ridicule, and it was found necessary
to employ lecturers to go about the country to
shew people how such an apparent impossibility
could be carried out. However, in spite of much
opposition, part of London was lighted by gas in
1812; and three years later, Paris adopted the
same system. The delay in the acceptance of gas-making
among the industrial arts was no doubt
largely due to the expressed opinion of several
eminent chemists and others, who considered that
such a mode of lighting our towns could never be
realised, because of the supposed danger which it
involved. Modern experience teaches us that it
is at once the cheapest as well as the safest mode
of illumination that we can as yet command. In
the manufacture of gas, the coal is placed in iron
retorts, which are subjected to a high temperature
for about six hours, when the operation is finished,
and the retorts are ready for a fresh charge. A
residue of nearly pure carbon, in the form of coke,
remains in the retort, whilst the varied products
of the distillation are carried off by pipes into
suitable receptacles. For the sake of convenience,
we will at present name only three of these products—ammoniacal
liquor, tar, and the gas itself.
The first is the principal source of ammonia, one
of the most useful substances known. It may be
almost said of ammonia, as it has been remarked
of sulphuric acid, that the prosperity of a country
may be known by the quantity which it consumes.
It is used by colour-makers, calico-printers, and
in the manufacture of most of the textile fabrics;
in cleansing and extracting grease from various
kinds of cloth, in the preparation of leather, in
galvanising iron, and in pewtering. The chemist
would be almost helpless without its aid; whilst
in medicine it is used in about twenty different
forms as a most valuable stimulant. It is almost
needless to say that ammonia was in general use
long before the era of gas-manufacture, for life
could hardly go on without it. In fact its very
name is derived from its manufacture hundreds
of years ago from animal refuse in a district of
Libya where the deity Jupiter Ammon was
worshipped. The old alchemists too obtained it
from the distillation of deer’s horns; hence one
preparation of it is still called spirit of hartshorn.
There are many other sources of ammonia, for its
presence in nature is universal; but all have sunk
into insignificance since the gas-works have yielded
such plentiful supplies.</p>

<p>Coal-tar in its crude state is not of very great
importance, its use being confined to such rough
work as the water-proofing of boats and the painting
of outhouses and the like. But in the hands
of the chemist its applications cannot be lightly
regarded, in fact its distillation is of sufficient
importance to form a distinct branch of trade. In
this process coal-tar is separated into three different
products—naphtha (which in a rectified state is the
benzol of commerce); heavy or creosote oil, which
is used almost exclusively for the preservation
of railway sleepers; and the residue pitch. The
last is of great use to shipbuilders, and has more
recently found employment in the preparation of
asphalt roofing and paving. But naphtha is by far
the most important of the three substances, if it
were only for its use as a solvent for both india-rubber
and gutta-percha. No doubt, failing this,
other solvents for caoutchouc would have been
found; but naphtha is a particularly cheap and
effective menstruum for the purpose; and when we
consider the varied uses to which india-rubber and
gutta-percha are now applied—from elastic hosiery
to submarine cables—we must acknowledge that
naphtha is a valuable addition to our manufacturing
resources. It is a significant circumstance
that the date of the introduction of manufactured
india-rubber (by Mr Mackintosh) follows the
general adoption of gas-lighting by only a few
years. Previous to this, india-rubber was imported
merely as a curiosity, its first use being to obliterate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>{122}</span>
pencil-marks, for which purpose it was once
advertised in London at the modest price of six
shillings per square inch.</p>

<p>Besides its use as a solvent, benzol is of particular
importance in yielding, when treated with
nitric acid, a substance called aniline. The discovery
of aniline is one of the most remarkable
triumphs of chemistry, as applied to the advancement
of a manufacturing industry. (Before the
date of coal-tar it was obtained from indigo, and
the name it bears is the Portuguese for that
colour.) The production of aniline caused quite
a revolution in the various trades which are dependent
in any way upon the colour-manufacturer;
for lithographers, paper-stainers, calico-printers,
and especially dyers, owe their most brilliant tints
to its aid. The various dyes which are now
commonly retailed for household use are also
derived from the same source. Aniline is an
almost colourless liquid, of a peculiar vinous
odour, which after exposure to the air, changes
to a dark resinous matter. The treatment which
it undergoes in producing the various colours
(and nearly every colour of the rainbow can now
be obtained from it), is of too complicated a
nature to be of any interest to the general reader.
Magenta, the advent of which some years back
many of our readers will remember, was the first
aniline dye which appeared. The other colours
have followed in quick succession, nearly all of
them being the subjects of one or more patents.
It is questionable whether all these colours are
strictly permanent; but it is a pleasing thought
that the hues which in one form or another
existed at a period long before mankind had a
place in nature, are now reproduced for man’s
delight and benefit.</p>

<p>Another very important product of gas-tar is
carbolic acid, which is also largely employed for
dyeing purposes. Its value as a disinfectant is too
well known to need recapitulation here; but we
may mention that its use as a preventive of
disease was most abundantly proved during the
last epidemic among our cattle. It is in general
use in our hospitals, not only as a disinfectant,
but also as an antiseptic both in the dressing of
wounds and in the treatment of various skin
diseases. Carbolic acid also yields a substance
called picric acid, which, on account of its explosive
properties when combined with potassium,
has been proposed as a substitute for gunpowder.
There are many other substances derived from
the distillation of coal-tar, but at present they are
only of interest to the experimental chemist.</p>

<p>A ton of coals will produce a chaldron of coke,
twelve gallons of tar, ten gallons of ammoniacal
liquor, and nearly ten thousand feet of gas. A
consideration of these figures, with a due regard
to what we have said as to the value of the various
chemical products obtained by distillation, will
enable our readers to understand why gas companies
can shew such good balance-sheets. Much
has been written as to the possible exhaustion,
after one or two centuries, of the British coal-fields.
This is a question upon which it is next
to impossible to form any reliable opinion. Should
the coal-supply actually fail, it is more than
probable that as science is extended, a new source
of light and heat may be developed. A cheap
and ready means of producing electricity, as we
have in a former article endeavoured to shew,
would at once solve the problem, and it is within
the bounds of reason that to this agency the
future races of the earth will look for the two
most common necessaries of existence.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span> once wrote to a friend: ‘I have
distinguished myself in two respects lately. I took
a young lady unknown down to dinner, and talked
to her about the Bishop of Durham’s nepotism
in the matter of Mr Cheese. I found she was Mrs
Cheese. And I expatiated to the member for
Marylebone, Lord Fermoy—generally conceiving
him to be an Irish member—on the contemptible
character of the Marylebone constituency and
Marylebone representatives.’ Two such mishaps
in one evening were enough to reduce the most
brilliant talker to the condition of the three
‘insides’ of the London-bound coach, who beguiled
the tedium of the journey from Southampton by
discussing the demerits of William Cobbett, until
one of the party went so far as to assert that
the object of their denunciations was a domestic
tyrant, given to beating his wife; when, much
to his dismay, the solitary lady passenger, who
had hitherto sat a silent listener, remarked:
‘Pardon me, sir; a kinder husband and father
never breathed; and I ought to know, for I am
William Cobbett’s wife!’</p>

<p>Mr Giles of Virginia and Judge Duval of Maryland,
members of Congress during Washington’s
administration, boarded at the house of a Mrs
Gibbon, whose daughters were well on in years,
and remarkable for talkativeness. When Jefferson
became President, Duval was Comptroller of
the Treasury, and Giles a senator. Meeting one
day in Washington, they fell to chatting over old
times, and the senator asked the Comptroller if he
knew what had become of ‘that cackling old maid,
Jenny Gibbon.’ ‘She is Mrs Duval, sir,’ was the
unexpected reply. Giles did not attempt to mend
matters, as a certain Mr Tuberville unwisely
did. This unhappy blunderer resembled the Irish
gentleman who complained that he could not open
his mouth without putting his foot in it. Happening
to observe to a fellow-guest at Dunraven Castle,
that the lady who had sat at his right hand at
dinner was the ugliest woman he had ever beheld;
the person addressed expressed his regret that he
should think his wife so ill-looking. ‘I have
made a mistake,’ said the horrified Tuberville; ‘I
meant the lady who sat on my left.’ ‘Well, sir,
she is my sister,’ was the response to the well-intentioned
fib; bringing from the desperate connoisseur
of beauty the frank avowal: ‘It can’t be
helped, sir, then; for if what you say be true,
I confess I never saw such an ugly family in the
course of my life!’</p>

<p>An honest expression of opinion perhaps not
so easily forgiven by the individual concerned,
as that wrung from Mark Twain, who, standing
right before a young lady in a Parisian public
garden, cried out to his friend: ‘Dan, just look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>{123}</span>
at this girl; how beautiful she is!’ to be rebuked
by ‘this girl’ saying in excellent English: ‘I
thank you more for the evident sincerity of the
compliment, sir, than for the extraordinary publicity
you have given it!’ Mark took a walk,
but did not feel just comfortable for some time
afterward.</p>

<p>One of the humorist’s countrymen made a much
more serious blunder. He was a married man.
Going into the kitchen one day, a pair of soft
hands were thrown over his eyes, a kiss was
imprinted on his cheek. He returned the salute
with interest, and as he gently disengaged the
hands of his fair assailant, asked: ‘Mary, darling,
where is the mistress?’ and found his answer in
an indignant wife’s face. ‘Mary darling’ had
gone out for the day, and the lady of the house
intended by her affectionate greeting to give her
lord a pleasant surprise. He got his surprise;
whether he thought it a pleasant one he never
divulged, but that kitchen knew Mary no more.</p>

<p>A stout hearty-looking gentleman one day made
his way from the dock-side at Plymouth to the
deck of a man-of-war newly arrived from abroad,
and desired to be shewn over the ship. Most of
the officers were on shore, and the duty of playing
cicerone devolved upon a young midshipman.
He made the most of his opportunity, and to have
a lark at the expense of the elderly gentleman as he
shewed him round, he told him how the capstan
was used to grind the ship’s coffee, the eighteen-ton
guns for cooling the officers’ champagne, the main-yards
for drying the Admiral’s Sunday shirts, and
many other things not generally known. When
the gentleman had seen all he wanted to see, he
handed a card to his kind instructor, saying:
‘Young gentleman, you are a very smart youth
indeed, and full of very curious information; and
I trust that you will see there is no mistake in this
card of mine finding its way to your captain.’ The
middy glanced at the bit of pasteboard and read
thereon the name ‘Ward Hunt;’ but before he
could thoroughly realise the situation, the First
Lord of the Admiralty, with a parting nod and
pleasant smile, had gone.</p>

<p>Another story, illustrating the awkward results
that come of letting the tongue wag freely under a
misapprehension regarding other folk’s identity, is
told of a London tailor. An aristocratic customer
noted for dressing in anything but aristocratic
fashion, called to pay his bill. The tailor’s new
manager, after receipting the account, handed it
back with a sovereign, saying: ‘There’s a sovereign
for yourself, and it’s your own fault it isn’t two.
You don’t wear out your master’s clothes half
quick enough. He ought to have had double the
amount in the time; it would be worth your
while to use a harder brush.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know,’ said his lordship, smiling;
‘I think my brush is a pretty hard one too; his
lordship complains of it anyhow.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh! Hard! Not a bit of it! Now I’ll put
you up to a dodge that’ll put many a pound in
your pocket. You see this piece of wood—now
that’s roughened on purpose. You take that, and
give your master’s coat a good scrubbing with it
about the elbows and shoulders every day; and
give the trousers a touch about the knees, and it
will be a good five pounds a year in your pocket.
We shan’t forget you.’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind,’ quoth the enlightened
gentleman. ‘I will impart your instructions to my
valet, though I fear while he remains in my service
he will not be able to profit by them, as I shall not
trouble you with my custom. I wish you good-day.’</p>

<p>We read in Lord Eldon’s Journal: ‘The most
awkward thing that ever occurred to me was this.
Immediately after I was married I was appointed
Deputy Professor of Law at Oxford, and the Law
Professor sent me the first lecture, which I had to
read immediately to the students, and which I
began without knowing a single word that was in
it. It was upon the statute applying to young
men running away with maidens. Fancy me
reading with about one hundred and fifty boys
and young men all giggling at the Professor!
Such a tittering audience no one ever had.’ The
comical coincidence may have been an accidental
one; but as the Law Professor must, like the
students, have known that his deputy ran away
with his Bessie, the chances are against it. The
great lawyer was fated to be reminded of the
romantic episode of his life. A client whose
daughter had been stolen from him, insisted upon
the jury being told that a man who could run
away with another man’s daughter was a rascal
and a villain, and deserved to be hanged. ‘I
cannot say that,’ said Scott. ‘And why not,
Lawyer Scott—why not?’ inquired the irate
father. ‘Because I did it myself!’ was the unanswerable
reply.</p>

<p>After doing his office for a young couple, a
clergyman was inveigled into proposing the health
of bride and bridegroom at the wedding breakfast.
He wound up a neat little speech by expressing
the hope that the result of the union of the happy
pair might prove strictly analogous to that of
the bride’s honoured parents. The groom looked
angry, the bride went into hysterics, the bridesmaids
blushed and became interested in the
pattern of the carpet, the master of the house blew
his nose with extraordinary violence, and the
speaker sat down wondering at the effect he had
created; till his better-informed neighbour whispered
that the lady was not the daughter of the
host and hostess, but a niece who came to live
with them when her mother and father were
divorced.</p>

<p>During Mr Gladstone’s Premiership, Sir George
Pollock called one morning in Downing Street
to thank the Prime-minister for making him
governor of the Tower. A cabinet council had just
assembled; but rather than keep the veteran waiting,
Mr Gladstone invited him into the council-chamber
and introduced him to his colleagues.
Sir George entertained his new acquaintances with
a tedious story about a nobleman who had been
detected cheating at cards, ending his narration
with: ‘They turned him out of all the clubs he
belonged to; even the Reform would have nothing
more to say to him!’ A way of proving the
enormity of the card-player’s offence that must
have pleased his hearers amazingly, since all or
nearly all of them were members of that famous
Liberal club.</p>

<p>The old governor sincerely meant what his words
implied. Such is not always the case with utterers
of malapropos things. When a note was handed
to Dr Fletcher in his pulpit intimating that the
presence of a medical gentleman, supposed to be
in the church, was urgently required elsewhere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>{124}</span>
the preacher read the letter out, and as the doctor
was making for the door, fervently ejaculated:
‘May the Lord have mercy on his patient!’ A
Scotch minister exchanging pulpits with a friend
one Sunday, was accosted after service by an old
woman anxious to know what had become of her
‘ain minister.’ ‘Oh,’ said he, ‘he is with my
people to-day.’ ‘Indeed, indeed,’ said the dame;
‘they’ll be getting a treat the day!’ As flattering
a remark as that of the wife of a popular lecturer,
who on her lord telling her he was going to lecture
at Sheffield, exclaimed: ‘I’m so glad; I always
hated those Sheffield people.’</p>

<p>Epitaph writers sometimes display a talent for
this kind of <i>double-entendre</i>. A couple of specimens
will suffice. The first from Arbroath, running:
‘Here lie the bodies of John, William,
Robert, and David Matthews, who all died in the
hope of a glorious resurrection—excepting David.’
The other from an American burying-ground:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here lies the mother of children five;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two are dead and three are alive;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The two that are dead preferring rather</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To die with their mother than live with their father.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although a high authority insists that the
lunatic and the lover are of imagination all compact,
it would not enter an ordinary lover’s head
to tell his mistress that loving her was synonymous
with madness, as Steele did when he wrote to
his dear lovely Prue: ‘It is the hardest thing
in the world to be in love and yet attend business.
As for me, all who speak to me found me out, and
I must lock myself up, or other people will do it
for me;’ but fair Mistress Scurlock doubtless took
the dubious flattery in as good part as the great
animal painter took the king of Portugal’s odd
greeting: ‘Ah, Sir Edwin, I am glad to see you;
I’m so fond of beasts.’ An unpleasant way of
putting the thing was innocently adopted by the
New York car-driver, who, blissfully ignorant that
his interlocutor was Mr Beecher, replied to that
gentleman’s query whether he did not think it
possible to dispense with running the cars all
day on Sunday: ‘Yes, sir, I do; but there’s no
hope for it so long as they keep that Beecher
theatre open in Brooklyn; the cars have to run
to accommodate that.’</p>

<p>An American newspaper says: ‘The enthusiastic
choir-master who adopted <i>Hold the Fort</i> as a
processional hymn, has been dismissed by the
minister, who considered it personal when the
choir burst forth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See the mighty host advancing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Satan leading on!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A similar objection might have been raised to
the Maine county commissioners quoting Watts’s
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye sinners round, come view the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where you will shortly lie,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>when inviting certain lawyers to inspect the new
court-house; although they had less reason to
complain than Lord Kenyon and Justice Rooke,
who while on circuit, came one Sunday to a little
village just as the good folks were going to church;
an example the two judges followed. Anxious
to shew his appreciation of the unexpected honour,
the parish clerk searched for a suitable psalm
to sing before the service; and at the proper time
gave out the first two verses of the fifty-eighth
psalm, and the congregation sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak, O ye judges of the earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If just your sentence be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or must not innocence appeal</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To heaven from your decree.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your wicked hearts and judgments are</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Alike by malice swayed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your griping hands, by mighty bribes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To violence betrayed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the congregation awoke to the meaning of
what they were singing, and left the clerk and
the children to offend the ears of the legal dignitaries
with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To virtue, strangers from the womb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Their infant steps went wrong;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They prattled slander, and in lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Employed their lisping tongue.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No serpent of parched Afric’s breed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The drowsy adder will as soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Unlock his sullen ear.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The performance unlocked the tongues of the
astonished judges at any rate; and the churchwardens
had some difficulty in convincing them
that the apparent insult arose out of the stupidity
of the well-meaning clerk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THEODOR_MINTROP">THEODOR MINTROP.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">The</span> poor world is almost six thousand years old,
and in all this time there was not any man died in
his own person, namely, in a love-cause.’</p>

<p>I cannot help recalling Rosalind’s words as I
look at the photograph before me; the history of
its original so completely disproves her saucy
speech. In my hand I hold the likeness of a man
of forty or thereabouts, with a noble square forehead
arching above deep thoughtful eyes, a large
beardless face surrounded by a heavy growth of
long hair, and a thickset form denoting great personal
strength. A superficial observer might call
the homely portrait commonplace, and turn to gaze
on the more aristocratic faces of his fellow-artists
in the photographic album; but a careful scrutiny
of the coarse irregular features and the broad brow
impresses one with the feeling that this was no
ordinary man; that a spirit dwelt within these
steady eyes purer and mightier than usually falls
to the lot of mortal man. But the closest inspection
would still leave much untold. The indomitable
energy, the heaven-sent genius, may be traced
in his strong features and deep eyes; but the
exquisite sensibility, the single-heartedness, the
uncomplaining patience, would never be guessed.</p>

<p>But a short time has elapsed since he was one
of us, and his story is still ringing in the hearts
of his countrymen—a story so pathetic in its
poverty and its triumph, so touching in its untimely
close.</p>

<p>Theodor Mintrop, the original of the photograph,
was born near the village of Werden in Westphalia.
From his childhood he had an uncontrollable desire
to draw, which brought nothing but censure from
his elders, substantial <i>bauers</i> and petty farmers,
who considered drawing an unpardonable waste of
time. But the talent was not to be crushed out.
In spite of opposition and discouragement, in spite
of his daily hard work on his father’s farm, he
practised his art whenever he had an opportunity;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>{125}</span>
at first sketching rough outlines on whitewashed
walls, and when he could afford it, buying pencils
and paper. In time his fame as an artist spread
among the simple peasantry, and even beyond his
own limited circle. ‘The country Raphael,’ he was
popularly called; and made a little money occasionally
by painting signs for country inns, and
pictures of the Virgin and Child for the Catholics.
All this time he wrought in the fields at a
labourer’s usual avocations; and it was a hard
horny hand that in his leisure moments wielded
the pencil with such surprising genius. He was
waiting—waiting patiently till the tide would
turn—waiting till the time would come when
he could study his art and devote himself wholly
to it. And thus he might have spent his entire
life, his genius, like an imprisoned bird, hemmed
in by sordid cares and toils, if one of these strange
coincidences that so often bring the unexpected,
had not occurred.</p>

<p>A celebrated artist, seeing some of Mintrop’s
drawings, was so struck by their merit, that he
immediately set out for Werden, found Mintrop
at the plough, and carried him back to his house
in Düsseldorf, offering him every facility for
studying thoroughly his beloved art.</p>

<p>The opportunity had come; but how long the
country Raphael had waited for it! Thirty years
had he repressed his ambition, and performed the
duties of farm-labourer for his father and brother.
No wonder a sad weariness can be traced on his
features. In Düsseldorf, Mintrop went through the
regular course of instruction, beginning at the very
lowest class, where he, a man of thirty, sat on the
same bench with young lads; but his great genius
and intense application soon carried him through
the class-rooms. His art had an amount of originality
and freshness that seemed to breathe of
his free country life at Werden. From his boyhood
a great lover of fairy tales, there was a
strain of grotesqueness in his works. His father,
a man of an original turn of mind, had fostered
his passion for the weird homely legends of the
German peasantry; and to Theodor, in his imaginative
youth, <i>kobolds</i> had peeped out of the earth,
<i>nixies</i> had sung in the rivers. The fame of the
country Raphael soon spread in Düsseldorf; art
critics acknowledged his wonderful genius, and
vied with one another in pointing out the grand
simplicity and admirable power of his compositions.
How did the untrained peasant, fresh
from his rural life, bear all this homage? Simply
and meekly. With reverence he regarded the
wonderful new life around him, so much more
polished, so much pleasanter than his old one;
but the dignity of his art and his own self-respect
saved him from being overborne by it. But no
one guessed that under his homely and somewhat
uncouth exterior such an appreciation for all that
was fair and good in life existed, as the sequel of
his life proved.</p>

<p>Behold him now at perhaps the zenith of his
career; having attained the object of his desires,
an artistic education; having in a few short years
established a fame that many academical pupils
of many years’ standing had failed to win; surrounded
by many friends, living in the home-circle
of his first patron and dearest friend in that
pleasant city on the Rhine. His future lay fair
and unclouded before him, leading him on from
triumph to still greater triumph. But inscrutable
are the ways of Providence; God’s ways are not
man’s ways; and the tree that promised such
glorious fruit was never to reach maturity.</p>

<p>To the house of Geselschap (the name of the
artist who had befriended Mintrop, and in whose
house he lived) came one fine summer a young
lady-friend. In the free unrestrained home society,
Mintrop had much opportunity of becoming intimately
acquainted with this young girl. He had
been learning much of life as well as art since
he came to Düsseldorf; but women in a higher
rank than the peasants he had for thirty years
been familiar with, were ever an object of peculiar
interest and intense admiration to him; and the
grace and amiability of this stranger soon made a
powerful impression on him. For a whole long
happy summer this fair young creature lived under
the same roof with him, and treated the grave
shy man with the playfulness and friendliness
of a sister, wholly unaware of the passion she had
unwittingly kindled. In short he, the hard-working
country Raphael, engrossed in his art, which
he pursued for itself, not for money (about which
he was one of the most careless of mortals)—he,
the rough Westphalian peasant, with hard
hands and uncouth figure, had learned to love this
gentle maiden, with all the strength of his noble
patient heart.</p>

<p>That long happy summer passed, and the young
lady returned to her friends. Shortly after, the
announcement of her engagement to be married
reached Düsseldorf, piercing the true heart that
loved her so well. To commemorate her marriage,
Mintrop composed a wonderful series of pictures,
that will always link her name to his.</p>

<p>The ‘Love of King Heinzelmann’ they were
called; seventy scenes in all, in which he, in the
guise of King Heinzelmann, following his beloved
Johanna through every incident in daily life, protects
and helps her as he would fain have done
in reality. True to the traditions of his youth,
numbers of quaint dwarfs with long beards,
pointed caps, and trunk-hose, attend on the commands
of their king; who is himself a strange
weird vision with a wizened face, pointed cap, and
magic wand, tipped by a burning eye. In a
burgher household, these droll figures sweep and
wash, bake and brew, throwing themselves into
many strange contortions, in the service of Anna;
the king ever with them, looking sadder and
sadder; for as time goes on, a stranger from
America falls in love with Johanna and carries
her away across the sea. The poor gnome-king
loves in vain; and when the day comes that
Johanna and her lover sail away, he and his
dwarfs stand sadly on the shore (for they may not
cross the sea) watching the vessel till it fades from
sight.</p>

<p>The fantastic legend is imbued with a strange
humanity; and the ugly figure of the gnome-king
touches our inmost sensibility with a thrill of
pathos. Such was the love of Mintrop—intense,
undying, and hopeless! Some things are almost
too sad to bear speaking of, and the waste of
affection that goes on in this world is one of
them. Doubtless there were many girls in Düsseldorf
equal to Johanna in every respect; but for
Mintrop she was the only one, and yet she was
another’s.</p>

<p>Three years had passed since Mintrop worked his
love into his art—throwing but a thin veil of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>{126}</span>
grotesqueness over his real feelings; and Johanna
returned from afar with her husband. They
settled in Westphalia; and Johanna, moved by
the memories of old days, proposed that Mintrop
should be godfather to their infant daughter.
Three years were gone, and Mintrop thought he
had conquered his hopeless love; but yet the
request startles him, and he requires to struggle
for composure before he can determine whether he
shall agree to it or not. He goes, finds the comfortable
home where his lost love resides, meets
her and her husband and the various guests present
at the ceremony. The priest comes, and the little
soft baby is placed in his arms. He looks at his
sleeping god-daughter as he somewhat awkwardly
receives her, and the child slowly opens her large
eyes, so like her mother’s. A thrill runs through
Mintrop’s veins; all the old feelings, the old hopes
and fears, rush through his mind with a force too
cruel to be borne. He hastily places the child
in its mother’s arms, and hurries away from the
scene.</p>

<p>Not long after, and Mintrop is dying. Some
physical cause, the doctor assigns; but his friends
know well what it is. His patient loving heart
has borne too much. The intensity of his feelings
has snapped the cord of life. As his breath leaves
him, he thinks of his other love, his Art, and he
sighs: ‘Would I might live long enough to finish
my work; otherwise, I am ready to die!’ And
thus the brave gentle spirit went forth to meet its
Maker, regretting only that the promise of its youth
was not fulfilled—the work not yet completed.
Alas, alas, for human love, for human hopes and
wishes! My eyes are wet as I trace these concluding
lines; and the face in the photograph is
hallowed by a strange sad interest.</p>

<p>Theodor Mintrop died at Düsseldorf in July
1870; and his sad story, as given above, speedily
found its way into the German newspapers. In
autumn 1871, a bronze bust erected to his memory
was unveiled in the presence of thousands of spectators;
and the poet Emil Rittershaus composed
and recited a beautiful poem—a requiem to one
who died of a broken heart.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MONTH">THE MONTH:
<br />
SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rumour mentioned in our last <i>Month</i> has
been verified, and we now know that hydrogen
and nitrogen have yielded to the power of the
physicist, and that there is no longer, in our part
of the universe, any such thing as a permanent
gas. After Pictet in Geneva had led the way
by liquefying oxygen, Cailletet followed in Paris
with the other two; but Pictet has since gone
farther, and has obtained liquid hydrogen in
considerable quantity, and has produced solid
particles of oxygen. In communicating these facts
to a scientific body in Paris, Mr Dumas, the eminent
chemist, stated to his hearers they might
take it for granted that in swallowing a glass of
water they were really drinking a metallic
oxide.</p>

<p>Dr Angus Smith says in a paper ‘On the
Examination of Air,’ read before the Royal Society,
that there ought to be observatories for Chemical
Climatology and Meteorology, in which the air
should be systematically examined, ‘so as to
obtain decidedly those bodies which have from
the earliest times been supposed to exist in it,
bringing with them, on certain occasions, the
worst results.’ But the process of examination,
as at present carried on, is slow and troublesome;
when a sure and easy way is found, then its adoption
may become general. Dr Angus Smith is
perhaps the first who has taken the subject in
hand from this point of view. ‘It is the more
interesting,’ he remarks, ‘as he has sufficiently
shewn that in the places examined, the organic
ammonia has been in intimate relation with the
gross death-rate.... It may be true that oxygen
is the prime mover—producing in man animal
life—a favourite idea for a chemist; but it may
also be true that minute organisms cause a peculiar
class of decomposition connected with mental or
other activity, diseased or otherwise.’</p>

<p>Before the telephone has ceased to be a scientific
novelty, America sends us news of another novelty
called a phonograph. This instrument, the invention
of Mr T. A. Edison, makes sound visible,
and records it in a permanent form. You speak
into a tube, and while doing so you work a
handle which causes a cylinder to revolve; the
sound of the voice causes a thin disk or diaphragm
of metal to vibrate, as in the telephone; the vibrations
actuate a steel point which, as it advances
and recedes, makes impressions more or less deep
in a band of tinfoil wound round the cylinder,
and this band of tinfoil becomes the record of what
has been spoken. Now comes the wonderful part
of the process; for we are told that if the tinfoil
so indented be applied to another instrument,
called the ‘transmitter,’ consisting of a hollow
tube with a paper diaphragm, then the original
sounds will be reproduced, though with somewhat
of a metallic tone. Turn the handle of
the cylinder and you may have repetitions of the
discourse until, in fact, the tinfoil is quite worn
out. Casts of the indented tinfoil may, it is said,
be taken in plaster of Paris, so that copies of
spoken words could be sent to as many persons
as may be desired.</p>

<p>This invention seems too questionable to allow
of any one, even the inventor, forming an opinion
as to its practical value. Fanciful conjectures
may of course be made. A fugitive swindler, for
example, may be arrested in a foreign city, and
held fast until a foil of evidence spoken by one
of his confederates might be sent out to convict
him. Or a hardy young sheep-farmer in Australia
might sing into his tube, puncturing his song on the
sheet of foil, fold it neatly up, and send the graven
song home to the girl he left behind him; and she,
by applying the sheet to her own phonograph
might, by proper manipulation, hear the tender
ditty as often as she pleased.</p>

<p>While waiting for further developments, we
venture to suggest that what is wanted by numbers
of intellectual people who find the mechanical
action of writing slow and irksome, is, some kind
of ‘graphy’ which will enable them at once to
print their thoughts on paper without aid from
pen or fingers.</p>

<p>Some months ago we mentioned the little
torpedo boat <i>Lightning</i>, and her swift steaming,
nineteen knots an hour. Her length is eighty-four
feet, her width ten feet ten inches: and now we
hear that fifteen similar vessels are to be built, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>{127}</span>
that the builders promise a speed of twenty-five
knots. Experiments have been made which prove
that swiftness is an element of safety, for on firing
a rifle-bullet through the bottom it was found that
the water did not enter. In future it is thought
that torpedoes will play an important part in
naval warfare; and as has already been mentioned
in recent papers in this <i>Journal</i>, a School has been
established at Portsmouth in which their use is
taught theoretically and practically. A further
improvement is whispered in certain quarters—a
torpedo boat which shall carry on her evolutions
under water, and hook on torpedoes to the bottom
of an enemy’s ship without being discovered. Are
we about to see in this a realisation of what has
long been a dream among speculative inventors?
Is naval warfare, from its hopelessly fatal nature
to those engaged, to become an impossibility?</p>

<p>Communications addressed to the Société d’Encouragement
pour l’Industrie Nationale, Paris,
describe a method for preventing the deposit of
soot in chimneys; but as yet no details are published:
also an apparatus for stopping runaway
horses (in harness), by completely closing the
winkers; and a way to deaden the blows of a
hammer moved by machinery. In this case, the
anvil is supported on a float in a reservoir of water.
Another subject is a tramway car in which compressed
air is the motive-power, as proved during
some months on the line between Courbevoie and
Puteaux, and the Round Point in the Champs-Elysées.
This car has room for thirty passengers,
is served by a conductor, and a mechanician who
has entire charge of the machinery, which with a
number of iron tubes is all placed between the
wheels, under the floor, where it occasions no
inconvenience to any one. A powerful air-pump
at the starting station, forces air enough into the
iron tubes for the journey to and fro, and the car
travels smoothly and without noise or smoke, and
can be stopped and started more readily than a
horse-car. Mr Mékarski, the inventor of this car,
has been thanked by the Société for having solved
the problem of a locomotive which can be used
with safety in crowded streets. Of course there
are appliances for regulating the pressure of the air,
and for preventing the deposit of hoar-frost in the
tubes, consequent on rapid expansion of air; but
for a description of these and other particulars we
must refer to the <i>Bulletin</i> published by the Society.</p>

<p>Mr Coret has invented what he calls a self-acting
thermo-signal which by ringing a bell
makes known to all within hearing when an axle
or any other part of an engine is over-heated. It
is a small brass cylinder, containing a system of
flexible metal disks, and a dilatable liquid, which
is to be fixed to the part liable to over-heating.
While all goes well the instrument makes no
sign; but as the temperature rises the liquid
dilates, forces out a small metal pin at the end of
the cylinder, which, as the wheel revolves, strikes
a bell, and thereby warns the attendants. Thus
the necessity for constantly watching an indicator
is avoided.</p>

<p>Other subjects brought before the same Society
are—A description of a chimney which does not
occasion loss of heat, by Mr Toulet, 38 Avenue
de l’Observatoire, Paris—Specimens of harmless
colours which may be used with varnish, oil, or
water, and are described as durable and remarkably
brilliant. They are available for many purposes
of decoration, but are specially intended, as
they contain no poisonous element, for the colouring
of children’s toys. These new colours are
derived from the substances known to chemists as
eosin and fluorescin—And certain manufacturers
who have carefully studied the material give an
account of the capabilities of jute, from which we
gather that by proper preparation of the yarns,
remarkable effects of colour, of mottling, of light
and shade, and also a velvety appearance can be
produced. The process is described as very simple
and moderate in cost; so that applications of jute
to decorative purposes hitherto not thought of
may ere long become available.</p>

<p>It has been found by experiment that aniline
black can be made to yield different colours:
treated in one way it is a light violet, in another
way it is a bluish pink, and in a third way it
becomes blue.</p>

<p>Pure butter, as is stated in the <i>Journal</i> of the
Chemical Society, contains from ninety to ninety-eight
per cent. of pure butter fat and a small
quantity of water. Its colour should be from
yellowish white to reddish yellow, but this depends
on the kind of fodder given to the cows, and may
be produced by means of beetroot or other plants
possessed of colouring properties. The colouring
matter may be detected by treating the butter
with strong alcohol. The melting-point of pure
butter is from thirty to thirty-seven degrees, while
artificial butter melts at from twenty-seven to
thirty-one degrees. Substances used to increase
the bulk and weight of butter are chalk, gypsum,
oxide of zinc, starch, and so forth. These neither
improve its flavour nor its wholesomeness. The
agreeable smell of pure butter, with a slight suggestion
of milk, is not easy to imitate by artificial
means.</p>

<p>Now that chemists can avail themselves of the
spectroscope in their researches, falsifications have
but little chance of escaping detection. We learn
from the same <i>Journal</i> that the colouring matters
generally used in the adulteration of wine are—fuchsine,
the preparations termed caramels, ammoniacal
cochineal, sulphindigotic acid, logwood,
the lichen reds, rosaniline, bilberries, cherries,
mallows, and the berries of the privet. Most if
not all of these matters can be precipitated by
chemical treatment, or they may be detected by
dialysis. If a cube of gelatine less than an inch
square be placed in the wine under experiment,
it will be found, after twenty-four or forty-eight
hours, stained all through, if artificial colouring
matters are present; but if the wine is quite pure,
then the natural colouring matter will not have
penetrated deeper into the gelatine than one-eighth
of an inch. It is worth notice that the natural
colour soaks in slowly; the artificial colour quickly.</p>

<p>The <i>Comptes Rendus</i> of the Académie des
Sciences, Paris, give an account of a patient who,
through entire closure of the esophagus or gullet,
could get neither food nor liquid into his stomach,
and had to undergo the operation of gastrotomy.
Through the opening thus made the operator
passed different substances and took note of the
time they remained in the stomach. Starch, fat,
and flesh disappear in from three to four hours;
milk is digested in an hour and a half or two
hours, and alcohol and water are absorbed in from
thirty-five to forty-five minutes. One day a small
quantity of pure gastric juice was taken from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>{128}</span>
stomach for experiment: it is described as colourless,
viscid, yet easily filterable, having little
odour, and not putrefying spontaneously. The
acidity of the gastric juice varies but slightly
whether mixed with food or not, the mean being
1.7 gram of hydrochloric acid to one thousand
grams of liquid. ‘The quantity of liquid,’ we are
informed, ‘found in the stomach has no influence
on its acidity; the latter is almost invariable
whether the stomach be nearly empty or very
full. Wine and alcohol increase the acidity, while
cane-sugar diminishes it. If acid or alkaline
liquids are injected into the stomach, the gastric
juice reassumes its normal acidity in about one
hour. It is more acid during digestion than when
digestion is not going on, and the acidity increases
towards the end of the process. Since the stomach
is generally empty at the end of four hours, and
hunger does not supervene till about six hours
after a meal, it would seem that hunger does
not result solely from emptiness of the stomach.’
This last remark is not in accordance with the
opinions of other physiologists; but we venture
to suggest that in common with the limbs, the
stomach needs rest, and finds it in the two hours
of quiet above mentioned. We would further remark,
that the theory that sugar does not create
acid in the stomach is contrary to all ordinary
medical teaching, and even of daily experience.</p>

<p>A surgeon in a provincial town in Scotland has
achieved a remarkable operation. He cut out
from the neck of a patient a diseased portion
of the larynx, and inserted an artificial larynx
through which the man can speak articulately.
This is one of the triumphs of surgery.</p>

<p>We mentioned some time ago that certain practitioners
in the United States had succeeded in
removing tumours by the application of a current
of electricity. Recently the same method has
been employed, and with the same success, for
the removal of those blemishes from the skin
popularly described as ‘port-wine stains,’ and
other excrescences. Care is required in regulating
the strength and duration of the current according
to the nature of the case; if this be insured, the
operation can hardly fail of a successful result.
Particulars of cases and their treatment are published
in the <i>New York Medical Journal</i>.</p>

<p>Pursuing his contributions to meteorology, Professor
Loomis of Yale College, Newhaven, U.S.,
finds that the areas of rainfall in the United
States generally assume an oval form, and the oval
is not unfrequently a thousand miles long and
five hundred broad. He finds too that falls of rain
often have great influence in checking the progress
of a storm; and that they appear to be subject
to some law of duration. For example, some
rains last eight hours, some sixteen, some twenty-four;
but beyond twenty-four hours the instances
are very rare. ‘This fact,’ he remarks, ‘seems to
indicate that the causes which produce rain,
instead of deriving increased force from the rainfall,
rapidly expend themselves and become exhausted.
It cannot be explained by supposing
that the vapour of the air has all been precipitated,
because these cases chiefly occur near the Atlantic
coast, where the supply of vapour is inexhaustible.
Is there not here an indication that the forces
which impart that movement to the air which
is requisite to a precipitation of its vapour, become
exhausted after a few hours’ exercise?’ By further
research it is found that during the six months
from November to April, violent winds are more
than five times as frequent as during the other
six months of the year; and that they come from
a northern quarter two-and-a-half times more frequently
than from a southern quarter. Though
Professor Loomis’ observations apply to the climate
of America, they may be considered with advantage
by our own meteorologists.</p>

<p>The President of the Institution of Civil Engineers
in his inaugural address took occasion to say,
as evidence of the advantages which accrue to a
country through the labours of the civil engineer,
that the sum authorised to be expended on British
railways up to the end of 1876 amounted to seven
hundred and forty-two millions; a sum pretty
nearly as large as our huge national debt. And
from this Mr J. F. Bateman argued, that as in
engineering special qualifications, and some of a
high order, were required, it would be well if
advantage were taken of the numerous public
schools in which instruction bearing on engineering
is given, whereby young men would have at least
some qualification on entering the profession. At
the same time it would be a mistake to regard
that training as other than preparatory and incomplete.
It is by actual outdoor work only, that a
man can become an engineer; and engineering
work is not to be found at school or college.</p>

<p>Mr Bateman—who by the way will long be
remembered for his water-supply of Glasgow—instead
of travelling over many topics, confined
himself to the great and important question of
rainfall and water-supply for the whole kingdom,
with a view to proper economy. It is a question
which becomes more and more important with the
increase of population and consequent multiplication
of machinery. When the Metropolitan
Board of Works are about to ask parliament for
leave to undertake the water-supply of London,
the proportions of the question may be assumed
to be at their largest; and storage of rainfall and
of flood-waters, prevention of pollution, and the
best way of obtaining absolutely pure water,
together with other topics, will have to be treated
with serious consideration.</p>
